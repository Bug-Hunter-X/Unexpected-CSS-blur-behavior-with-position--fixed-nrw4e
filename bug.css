The CSS property `filter: blur()` is applied to an element with `position: fixed;`.  This can cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues because the blur effect might not be visible correctly or might affect elements behind the blurred element in unexpected ways.  It's also possible that the blur effect will be clipped by the viewport.
